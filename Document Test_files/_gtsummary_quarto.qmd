The NLSY79 Cohort is a longitudinal project that follows the lives of a sample of American youth born between 1957-1964. The cohort originally included 12,686 respondents ages 14-22 when first interviewed in 1979; after two subsamples were dropped, 9,964 respondents remain in the eligible samples. Data are now available from Round 1 (1979 survey year) to Round 30 (2022 survey year).
